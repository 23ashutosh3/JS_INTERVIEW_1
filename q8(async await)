it is the newest way to write asaynchronous code in javaScript.Async/Await was
 created to simplify the process of working with and writing chained promises.
 Async function return a Promise.If the function throws an error,
 the Promise will be rejectd.if the function returns a value,
 the promise will resolve.

The benefit of async functions increases in more complex examples. 
Say we wanted to stream a response while logging out the chunks, and 
return the final size.

 async function myFetch() {
  try {
    let response = await fetch('coffee.jpg');
    let myBlob = await response.blob();

    let objectURL = URL.createObjectURL(myBlob);
    let image = document.createElement('img');
    image.src = objectURL;
    document.body.appendChild(image);
  } catch(e) {
    console.log(e);
  }
}

myFetch();

ES6 provides a new way of declaring a constant by using the const keyword. 
The const keyword creates a read-only reference to a value.

const VARIABLE_NAME = value;

The const keyword works like the let keyword. But the const keyword creates block-scoped variables 
whose values canâ€™t be reassigned.

The variables declared by the let keyword are mutual. you can change its value any time.

let a = 10;
a = 20;
a = a + 5;
console.log(a);

However, variables created by the const keyword are immutable.
const RATE = 0.1;
RATE = 0.2;
